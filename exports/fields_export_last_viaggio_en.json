Today, after several renovations, the Cathedral is one of the best examples of English Gothic architecture.\r\nOvernight at the hotel in Canterbury.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 10: Canterbury \u2013 Dover (50 km\/ 32 mi.)| ferry to Dunkirk\r\n<\/strong>In the morning you will cycle the 34 km to Dover, famous for its white cliffs and one of the main ports of Great Britain. Here, you will board the <strong>ferry to Dunkirk, France<\/strong> (about 2 hours + 1 Time Zone).\r\nOnce in France, you will ride the 18 km separating the port to the city center, where your hotel is located.\r\nDunkirk is the third most important port in France. It is located in the <strong>Nord-Pas de Calais<\/strong> region, 10 km from the border with Belgium. At first glance, Dunkirk is an industrial town focused on maritime trade; however, when you look deeper, the <strong>unusual beauty<\/strong> of this place sets in with its dunes and long <strong>sandy beaches<\/strong> flourishing in flora and fauna. Kite-surfing and the famous surf on the sand are popular activities here. The city center is characterized by low buildings, mainly of the last century, and Flemish influences. The Church of St. Eloi and the two bell towers are included in the list of <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Sites<\/strong> and are well worth a visit.\r\nOvernight at the hotel in Dunkirk.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 11: Dunkirk \u2013 Bruges (79 km\/ 49 mi.)\r\n<\/strong>The main part of this stage occurs in <strong>Belgium<\/strong>.\r\nSeveral World War II battles took place here along the coast as French and British troops tried to block the German invasion. Once across the France-Belgium border, you will ride across the <strong>Flemish green countryside<\/strong>. Cycling along the coast of the North Sea, you will reach <strong>Ostend<\/strong>, a popular tourist destination on the Flemish coast characterized by its wide promenade bordered by shops, hotels and restaurants where you can taste excellent mussels, oysters and drink local beers.\r\nYour bike tour continues then through the <strong>Flanders<\/strong>\u00a0 and towards the <strong>romantic city of Bruges<\/strong>, where time seems to have stopped and everything runs slowly. Thanks to its myriad of canals, it is often referred to as <em>The\u00a0Venice\u00a0of the North<\/em>.\r\nOvernight at the hotel in Bruges.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 12: Bruges \u2013 Breskens (45 km\/ 28 mi.) | ferry to Vlissingen\r\n<\/strong>After breakfast, take some time to visit Bruges.\r\nWalking the narrow streets along the canals of the city centre, you will discover historic buildings, pubs serving <strong>local craft beers<\/strong>, and <strong>chocolate shops<\/strong>. A boat tour through the waterway network could be also a unique and interesting way to discover the city.\r\nIn the afternoon, you will continue our journey across the countryside Belgian-Dutch border.\r\nIn Breskens a short ferry transfer will allow you to cross quickly (in about 15 minutes) <strong>Scheldt River<\/strong> and reach <strong>Vlissingen<\/strong>, your final destination for the day. The promenade on the seafront, called <strong>Boulevard<\/strong>, is a long and beautiful walkway where a monumental prison tower dating from the fifteenth century is located.\r\nOvernight in Vlissingen.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 13: Vlissingen \u2013 Dordrecht by train | Dordrecht - Vianen (66 km\/ 41 mi.)\r\n<\/strong>After breakfast, a <strong>train transfer<\/strong> (1h30 approximately) will take you to Dordrecht, an elegant river town rich in art, theater life and architecture that gave birth to several accomplished artists including some students Rembrandt's pupils.\r\nYour journey continues towards\u00a0<b>Kinderdijk<\/b>, a\u00a0<strong>Unesco<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>World Heritage Site<\/strong> and probably the most famous polder of the Netherlands, thanks to the <strong>19<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>monumental\u00a0<\/strong><b>windmills<\/b> dating back to the 18<sup>th\u00a0\u00a0<\/sup>century. Some of the windmills are still functioning and it is possible to visit them.\r\nAfter the visit, you will keep cycling across Dutch countryside until you reach the city of Vianen, in the <strong>Province of\u00a0Utrecht<\/strong>.\r\nOvernight at the hotel in Vianen.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 14: Vianen \u2013 Amsterdam (65 km\/ 40 mi.)\r\n<\/strong>The first break of the day will be in the picturesque and offbeat <b>Utrecht<\/b>, one of the oldest cities of the Netherlands hosting today a vibrant university life.\r\nThe old city centre is full of historic mansions now turned into <strong>boutiques and cafes<\/strong> overlooking the canals.\r\nThe last part of the ride will be the introduction to your arrival in Amsterdam, well known for its <strong>canals and lined tilting buildings<\/strong>, for the open-minded atmosphere and of course the <strong>bicycles<\/strong>! Riding a bike is surely the best way to explore the city and mix up with the locals, but also a <strong>canal cruise<\/strong> <strong>at sunset<\/strong> is highly recommended.\r\nWhile exploring the city, don't forget to visit <strong>Dam Square<\/strong>\u00a0 and the many museums of art and history like the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rijksmuseum.nl\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Rijksmuseum<\/b><\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<b>Van Gogh Museum<\/b>, or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.annefrank.org\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><b>Anne Frank House.<\/b><\/a>\r\nOvernight at the hotel in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 15:<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>Amsterdam<\/strong>\r\nAfter breakfast, end of services.","scheda_tecnica":"This tour includes <a href=\"http:\/\/vnexport.webmapp.it\/en\/tours\/general-information\/#?anchor=plus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Support Service Plus<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Terrain<\/strong>: from Paris to London 2 days on flat terrain, 2 days on hilly terrain, 2 days on flat-to-hilly terrain.\r\nFrom London to Amsterdam primarily flat; hilly terrain between Canterbury and Dover (34 km).

Romagna is the land of hospitality, of good food, of parties and beach resorts along the \u201criviera romagnola\u201d and their colorful \u00a0sun umbrellas. Here you have the chance to taste the typical piadina with squacquerone cheese, passatelli served with beef stock, maltagliati and strozzapreti pasta and all different kinds of cascione, a typical savory pastry, not to mention the range of DOP wines with which to pair these courses, such as Sangiovese, Albana\u00a0 and Trebbiano. This land, reclaimed from the sea throughout the centuries, can offer nowadays a great abundance of naturalistic highlights. In the wetlands right behind the coastline, hundreds of different species of birds build their nests every year and pink flamingoes found their perfect settlement in the low waters of the marshes, becoming a well-known symbol of the area around Comacchio. Along this itinerary, art is an important asset, too. You will visit the Medieval center of Bologna, still intact and showcasing its famous many towers. Bologna is also known both as \u201cthe wise\u201d and \u201cthe fat\u201d: the first nickname comes from the fact that the first university of the Western world was founded here in 1088 and it has been in place ever since; the second one is due to its culinary tradition, so nourishing and rich as a generous dish of tagliatelle with the famous bolognaise sauce. Heading East from Bologna, you will arrive in Ferrara, where you follow the ancient walls of the city, still protecting from the dangers of the outer world the beautiful center and the imposing Este castle. Then, the unique mosaic works of Ravenna will simply leave you wordless. Moreover, this city hosts 8 monuments enlisted as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\r\n\r\nThis tour is a pleasant cycling exploration of a hard-working, flourishing yet tranquil region of Italy, where everything reflects the good Italian living, both if \u00a0we look at how the historical and artistic heritage is cherished and maintained and at how gastronomy and food have a special place in everybody\u2019s heart and agenda.","prog":"<strong>Total km 326\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 1<\/strong><strong>:<\/strong> <strong>Bologna\r\n<\/strong>Independent arrival in Bologna.

You are free for dinner; overnight in Bologna.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 2<\/strong> <strong>:<\/strong> <strong>Bologna \u2013 Ferrara (69 km)\r\n<\/strong>Right after breakfast, you start your exploration by pedaling through the most typical countryside of the Pianura Padana, the big flatland area characterizing a conspicuous portion of Emilia Romagna region. Fields of crops, ancient reclamation canals and long rows of poplars alternate each other while passing through many small historical towns. We enter the county of Ferrara and here the itinerary follows one of the many branches of the Po River, Po di Primaro, until this crosses with another branch, the Po di Volano, right beyond the walls of the ancient capital of the domain of the House of Este, Ferrara. Ferrara is also the \u201ccity of bicycles\u201d: we suggest you to visit its old center with the imposing Castle, the beautiful Duomo\u00a0 and the unique Palazzo dei Diamanti, where important art exhibitions are usually hosted. And do not forget to take an evening stroll through the Jewish Quarter, which inspired \u201cThe Garden of the Finzi-Continis\u201d book an subsequent movie.

Following the course of Po di Volano, you reach the Vallette di Ostellato natural oasis. The four meanders of the watercourse form a biotope that is one of a kind, mainly thanks to the big amount and variety of wildlife having found their habitat here, among which more than 150 species of waterfowl. You then pedal towards Comacchio, one of the most evocative towns of the Delta area, with its famous Trepponti three-branched bridge. Also visit Manifattura dei Marinati, the workshop where eels fished in the local water valleys are slowly cooked on huge skewers and then marinated. Do not forget to taste the local cuisine, with peculiar fish and eels courses, and Bosco Eliceo DOC wines. You are free for dinner, overnight in Comacchio.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 4: <\/strong><strong>Comacchio \u2013 Ravenna (44 km)\r\n<\/strong>In the morning light, the water valleys of Comacchio, with its large colony of pink flamingoes, offer a stunning mix of shades and colors over the shallow waters. You cycle around the vast basin of the valley and then reach the sea in Casalborsetti. The itinerary then starts following the coastline southward, crossing Porto Corsini and Marina di Ravenna, then heading again inland to reach the city of Ravenna, world-known for its mosaics. Eight are the UNESCO monuments you can visit here: the Basilica of San Vitale, the Mausoleo of Galla Placidia, the Battistero Neoniano, the Cappella of Sant\u2019Andrea, the Battistero of the Ariani, the Basilica of Sant\u2019Apollinare Nuovo, the Mausoleum of Theodoric and the Basilica of Sant\u2019Apollinare in Classe. We also suggest you to visit the Domus dei Tappeti di Pietra (literally \u201cthe house of the stone carpets\u201d), a mosaic flooring ensemble dating back to the VI century and brought to light only in 1994. Foodwise, you enter the land of \u201cpiadina romagnola\u201d and \u201cpassateli\u201d, always to be enjoyed with a glass of Sangiovese. You are free for dinner, overnight in Ravenna.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 5:<\/strong> <strong>Ravenna \u2013 Forlimpopoli (55 km)\r\n<\/strong>The course of the tour heads again towards the sea, crossing part of the Regional Park of the Delta of the Po River and the beautiful pinewoods of Lido di Classe until you reach Milano Marittima, one of the most known seaside resorts of the Riviera romagnola coastline. Then, you follow the course of the Savio River to go back towards the countryside, with its endless fields of crops and sunflowers. The final destination of today\u2019s stage is Forlimpopoli, a city founded by Romans on the ancient route Via Emilia and once accommodating pilgrims on their way to Rome. This is the birthplace of the Italian scholar and gastronome Pellegrino Artusi, undisputed father of the \u201cItalian cuisine\u201d. The monumental location of the Chiesa dei Servi houses today Casa Artusi, a research center focusing on gastronomy and home cooking traditions. Here you can taste traditional dishes or attend cooking classes in the prestigious school. You are free for dinner, overnight in agriturismo close to Forlimpopoli.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 6 <\/strong><strong>: Forlimpopoli \u2013 Imola (51 km)\r\n<\/strong>Following the direction of the Roman Via Emilia, you soon reach the city of Forl\u00ec. Thanks to its artistic heritage, this location deservers a stop: visit the Romanic Basilica of San Mercuriale with its XII century bell tower, Palazzo del Podest\u00e0 and Palazzo Albertini dating back to the fourteenth century and the museum area of San Domenico, hosting the Pinacoteca and important traveling art exhibitions. \u00a0Moving westward on the Via Emilia, you arrive in Faenza, the international capital of ceramics. As a matter of fact, \u201cfaience\u201d is often used in many European languages to describe glazed earthenware or pottery, especially a fine variety with highly colored designs. Beside the Museum of Ceramics, here you can also find more than 60 workshops where craftsmen and artists give shape to certified local pottery. The final destination for today is Imola, the following city along the Via Emilia, where the fortress dating back to the XII century stands out in the very heart of the town. Imola is also famous around the world for its Formula One racing circuit. You are free for dinner, overnight in Imola.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 7<\/strong><strong>: Imola - Bologna (48 km)\r\n<\/strong>Pedaling on the backroads in between the ancient Via Emilia and the Appennino hills, we cross the towns of Castel San Pietro, Ozzano and San Lazzaro di Savena. We cycle along the border of the Regional Park of the Gessi Bolognesi and Calanchi dell\u2019Abbadessa, characterized by some peculiar geological features and gypsum formations, \u00a0and we reach our departing and arrival destination of this circular tour: Bologna. Named by the Romans Bononia, during the Medieval Age the ancient walls surrounded the heart of the city, that used to count more than 100 towers. Nowadays only few towers are left, among which the two that are still the symbol of Bologna, Garisenda and Asinelli. The city center itself is still well preserved and it is one of the biggest you can visit in Europe. Enjoy a stroll through Piazza Maggiore and visit the Basilica of San Petronio and the Seven Churches complex. You are also in a place that is known all over Italy if not the world for its rich gastronomic traditions and culture. Bolognaise sauce (actually called \u201crag\u00f9\u201d) takes its name from Bologna, so does mortadella, also known worldwide as \u201cbologna\u201d. Here you will have the chance to taste its original \u2013 gourmet \u2013 taste. Then, tortellini, lasagna and tagliatelle will fill in the rest of the room on the table, and in your stomach. If you plan to attend a cooking class on how to prepare hand-made pasta, you are certainly in the right place. Pair everything up with a glass of Pignoletto DOC wine produced on the hills right behind the city and enjoy the Italian good living style.

Reaching Modena, don\u2019t miss a small tour in the city centre: the Cathedral and its famous bell tower Ghirlandina, enlisted as UNESCO Heritage,\u00a0 are worth a visit. Be tempted by the local cuisine: \u201ctortelli\u201d, cold cuts and \u201cgnocco fritto\u201d is something you definitely want to try.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 5: Modena \u2013 Bologna (55 km)<\/strong>\r\nHeading out of Modena, you will plunge into the countryside and the fruit orchards: this scenery surrounds you along the cycle path. Enjoy the ride at peace, away from the noise and the traffic, to reach Bologna, the capital of Emilia Romagna region. Here tradition and modernity are perfectly combined: you can stroll in Piazza Maggiore, admire the most ancient buildings dating back to Medieval times, and perceive the cultural atmosphere which animates this city, always ready to welcome new artistic and cultural hints.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 6: Bologna \u2013 Vaiano (by train) \u2013 Florence (41 km)<\/strong>\r\nA small transfer by train (about 1 hour) brings you to the small town of Vaiano, on the Bisenzio River, crossing the Appennini mountains and the border between Emilia Romagna and Tuscany. From Vaiano, you start descending towards Florence, cycling through a landscape which seems to be projected by a nature and art lover. Here, country houses, castles, abbeys and even the tiniest church of the countryside expresses art in its purest form. You end your tour in Florence, international capital of arts, where you can visit museums, galleries or you can simply enjoy a stroll along the river Arno, at\u00a0 sunset.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 7: Florence<\/strong>\r\nAfter breakfast the tour ends.","scheda_tecnica":"<strong>Terrain:<\/strong> mainly flat.

Dinner is on your own. Greenwich - a UNESCO World Heritage Site - is an ancient village overlooking the south bank of the River Thames. It is located just a few kilometers from the center of London. The Royal Observatory stands on the hill overlooking the village. From here, you can admire the Thames and St. Paul's Cathedral. The historic astronomical observatory is the location of Greenwich Prime Meridian, for which the village is known worldwide. When telling the time, GMT acronym stands for \u2018Greenwich Mean Time\u2019: every day at 1 pm, the red globe atop the observatory is dropped to mark the time. In the evening, a laser travels through the skies from the exact spot that marks the Prime Meridian. Greenwich is also a place rich in history, the birthplace of King Henry VIII, and hosts one of the most popular markets of the London area. This, together with the tranquility pervading the village, makes Greenwich one of the most fascinating areas of the capital.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 2 : Greenwich \u2013 Canterbury \u00a042 Km \/ 26 mi.\r\n<\/strong>After breakfast we begin the tour by cycling along the south bank of the river Thames to Dartford (31 km). Here we board a train and travel across the County of Kent to Whitstable (1h20). Kent is known as the \u2018Garden of England\u2019 for its green landscape dotted with some of the most beautiful and famous gardens of the UK. Once in Whitstable, we ride the last 10km by bike to the day\u2019s destination, Canterbury. This beautiful town is located on the main road between Dover and London. It is the starting point of the \u2018Via Francigena\u2019, a centuries-old pilgrim route reaching Rome, and, in spite of its medieval past, is now lively with students who come here from all over Europe to attend its important university. The city was the first capital of the Saxon Kingdom of Kent and the seat of the first Christian diocese of England, founded by St. Augustine. The magnificent Christ Church Cathedral dominates the narrow alleys and half-timbered houses of the old medieval city center. Today, after several renovations, the Cathedral is one of the best examples of English Gothic architecture.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 3 : Canterbury \u2013 Dover + ferry to Dunkirk \u00a050 km \/ 32 mi.\r\n<\/strong>We depart by bike early in the morning to cycle 34 km to Dover, famous for its white cliffs and one of the most important ports of Great Britain. Here, we board the ferry to Dunkirk, France (about 2 hours + 1 Time Zone). Once in France, we ride 18 km from the port to the center of the city. Dunkirk is the third most important port in France. It is located in the Nord-Pas de Calais region, 10 km from the border with Belgium. At first glance, Dunkirk is an industrial town focused on maritime trade; however, when you look deeper, the unusual beauty of this place sets in with its dunes and tens of kilometers of sandy beaches flourishing in flora and fauna. Kite-surfing and the famous surf on the sand are popular activities here. The city center is characterized by low buildings, mainly of the last century, and Flemish influences. The church of St. Eloi and the two bell towers are included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and are well worth a visit.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 4 :\u00a0 Dunkirk \u2013 Bruges 79 km \/ 49 mi.\r\n<\/strong>The majority of this stage occurs in Belgium. Several World War II battles took place here as French and British troops tried to block the German invasion. Once across the France-Belgium border, we ride through the Flemish green countryside. Cycling along the coast of the North Sea, we reach Ostend, a popular tourist destination on the Flemish coast characterized by its wide promenade bordered by shops, hotels and restaurants where you can taste excellent mussels, oysters and drink local beers. Our bike tour continues through the Flanders region towards the romantic city of Bruges, where time seems to have stopped and everything runs slowly. Thanks to its myriad of canals, it is often referred to as The\u00a0Venice\u00a0of the North.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 5 :\u00a0 Bruges \u2013 Breskens 45 km \u00a0+ \u00a0ferry to Vlissingen \/ 28 mi.\r\n<\/strong>After breakfast, take time to visit Bruges. As you walk through the city center, you will discover historic buildings, lace shops, pubs serving local beers, and an intricate network of canals. A boat tour through the waterway network is a unique and interesting way to discover the city. We continue our ride through the countryside along the Dutch border in the direction of Breskens. Here, we board a ferry for a short ride (about 15 minutes) to Vlissingen, the day\u2019s destination. This fishing town is home to shipyards and a naval academy. The promenade, called Boulevard, is a long and beautiful walkway where a monumental prison tower dating from the fifteenth century is located.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 6 : Vlissingen \u2013 Kinderdijk \u00a0- Dordrecht \u2013 Vianen \u00a0\u00a066 km \/ 41 mi.\r\n<\/strong>After breakfast, we transfer by train from Vlissingen to Dordrecht (1h30). Dordrecht is an elegant river town rich in art, theater life and architecture. This cultural center gave birth to several accomplished artists including students of Rembrandt. From here, we cycle through the Dutch countryside crossing flower gardens, walled cities, canals and dams. We continue northwards through pastures, orchards and meadows dotted with windmills until we reach the village of Vianen.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 7 :\u00a0 Vianen \u2013 Amsterdam \u00a0\u00a065 km \/ 40 mi.\r\n<\/strong>During the last cycling day, we travel first to Utrecht, an old city now vibrant with culture and university life. The historic center is characterized by medieval palaces and ancient buildings, proof of its deeply rooted history as rich trade port. Picturesque canals are fringed by wine cellars transformed into trendy clubs, pubs and coffee shops surrounding the docks. From Utrecht, we continue through charming towns and along canals on the way to Amsterdam, the cosmopolitan capital of the Netherlands. Amsterdam is famous for its waterways and canals, for its architecture, and especially for its open-minded society. In the world capital of bikes, cycling is definitely the most suitable way to visit the center. However, a tour of the canals by boat is highly recommended.

At 6 pm, directly at the hotel, welcome meeting with your tour guide and delivery of the bikes. Immersed in the light that is also source of its mild weather, Aix-en-Provence stands out for its elegance, abounding in the lively streets and plazas. History and everyday life blend together in a continuum of small boutiques, buoyant d\u00e9hors, heritage buildings, Baroque treasures, architectural landmarks. Here every fountain has a secret to hide, every palace has a story to be told. Dinner in restaurant and overnight stay.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 2: \u00a0Aix-en-Provence - Mouri\u00e8s\u00a0 62 km \/ 38 mi\r\n<\/strong>Leaving Aix-en-Provence behind, we cycle towards the inland of the region, pedaling the countryside through vineyards and olive groves. By tackling a few short climbs, we arrive in \u00c9guilles, an actual terrace over the gorgeous Provencal landscape. We reach Salon-de-Provence, long home to Nostradamus and world-known for the craftsmanship of soap. We then enter the perimeter of the Alpilles Regional Natural Park, created to preserve the specificity of the area and the bond between man and Nature deeply rooted in this territory. We cycle though the villages of Eygui\u00e8res and Aureille, finally arriving in Mouri\u00e8s.\u00a0 Dinner at the hotel and overnight stay.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 3: Mouri\u00e8s - Avignon\u00a0 43 km \/ 27 mi\r\n<\/strong>Soon after breakfast we will head to Les Baux, where we visit the castle and the \u2018Cathedral of Images\u2019, a one-of-a-kind art exhibition inside a tufa cave. We then start to descent towards Saint Remy across the centuries-old olive trees. This town is the epitome of Proven\u00e7al style, with its tiny lively squares with their typical public fountain, the varied boutiques and ateliers of the many local craftsmen and the boulevards lined with plane trees. Pedaling across the landscapes that inspired Van Gogh\u2019s masterpieces, we get to the shores of the river Rhone and to the entrance to the City of the Popes. Thanks to the monumental ensemble formed by the Saint B\u00e9n\u00e9zet bridge, the Cathedral of Notre-Dame des Doms and the Papal Palace, the city center is listed among the Unesco World Heritage Sites. However, this city will ultimately conquer your heart for its energy and liveliness. You are free for dinner. Overnight stay.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 4: Avignon \u2013 Cabri\u00e8res d\u2019Avignon\u00a0 40 km \/ 25 mi\r\n<\/strong>Today\u2019s exploration runs through hilltop villages, solitary farmhouses and flocks of sheep grazing peacefully among fields of lavender, olive groves and vineyards. We stop in Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, a place famous for its antique shops and the \u2018brochante\u2019 market. Bordering the Sorgue River, we arrive in Fontaine de Vaucluse. Here the view of crystalline waters flowing directly out of the rocks inspired the mighty Italian poet Francesco Petrarca to write his \u2018Clear, sweet fresh water\u2019 verses. We descent towards Cabri\u00e8res d\u2019Avignon, a small village where we can still see the remains of the Plague Wall that was constructed in 1721 to protect the inland population from the terrible deadly epidemic raging in Marseille. Dinner at the hotel and overnight stay.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 5: Cabri\u00e8res d\u2019Avignon\u00a0 \u2013 Cavaillon 56 km \/ 35 mi\r\n<\/strong>We will head straight to Gordes, one of the most stunning towns in the entire Provence. The local stones with which the houses are built change color according to the light, thus covering all possible shades of yellow you can imagine. From the many terraces of the town we will enjoy a unique view over the valley and the Luberon mountains. We then roll down towards another symbol of this region, which is the Cistercian S\u00e9nanque Abbey, immersed in its memorable sea of lavender. This daily stage never runs low in surprise and awe, as we move forward to Roussillon. The colors of the scene change completely and reds, oranges and yellows take over the landscape. This is due to the ochre caves thus earning to the area the name of \u2018Colorado Provencal\u2019. We will visit the area on foot. Back on our bikes, we will reach Cavaillon by riding the cyclepath at the foot of the Luberon mountains. Dinner in restaurant and overnight stay.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 6: Cavaillon \u2013 Aix-en-Provence \u00a0\u00a064 km \/ 40 mi\r\n<\/strong>The last stage of the tour brings us back to Aix-en-Provence. Firstly, we follow the course of the Rhone River riding along the Luberon, then continuing through a valley covered in vineyards. We will encounter the towns of Mallemort and Lambesc, where we will have the chance to taste the refined local wines for which this region is famous.

Today your adventure leads you through the heart of Tuscany, rich in art, scents and traditions. Departure by bike from Florence to Impruneta, a landmark for Italian terracotta art, where you can visit its ancient villas and the Basilica. After approximately 10 km, you reach Mercatale, a small town surrounded by the Chianti hills; here, you will have the chance to taste some local wines and products inside the wine cellar of the Palagio Castle. You are cycling along \"the road of wines\". You can\u2019t miss a visit to Greve in Chianti: the main public square with its original irregular triangle shape is still at the centre of the city life. You continue towards the fortified medieval village of Montefioralle dominating Greve, and then, after riding through the splendid village of Panzano, you reach Radda in Chianti. The Chianti area, situated between Florence and Siena, appears like a hilly landscape varied and colourful. It is here that the famous wine was born during the Etruscan Age. In Radda in Chianti, it is possible to admire the Palazzo Pretorio dating back to 1400 and the remains of the city walls and medieval towers.\u00a0Overnight in Radda in Chianti.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 3: Radda in Chianti - Siena (43 km)\r\n<\/strong>Today\u2019s itinerary leads you from Radda in Chianti to Siena. The first stop will be at the Meleto Castle, an ancient fortification transformed into a magnificent typical villa immersed in the Tuscan countryside. Cycling over the fortified village of Castagnoli, you will continue towards the famous Castle of Brolio which\u00a0 is rich in\u00a0 suggestions\u00a0 coming from\u00a0 ancient times. Here you can enjoy a wine tasting in the Ricasoli wine cellar. In the afternoon, pedalling through the colourful hilly surroundings, you will reach Siena, famous for its Palio. Visiting the city, you will discover some of the most remarkable monuments of Italy: Piazza del Campo, Palazzo Pubblico, and the Duomo di Siena, built\u00a0 in the 12<sup>th<\/sup> century and fully covered in white and dark-green precious marble.\u00a0Overnight in Siena.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 4: Siena \u2013 Montalcino \u2013\u00a0 Siena (70 km or 116 km)\r\n<\/strong>Leaving Siena and cycling through the rolling downs of the surroundings, you will come cross small villages such as Murlo. From here on, you will be surrounded by the famous Brunello vineyards and it is pedalling through vineyards that you reach the town of Montalcino.\u00a0 After stopping for a glass of local wine, you continue\u00a0 towards Asciano and Monte Oliveto Abbey, a spot that is ideal for a peaceful pause. You are now in the area known as\u00a0 \u201cCrete Senesi\u201d, the Siena clays. This\u00a0 territory includes in itself everything we have come to associate with the idea of Tuscany: a landscape of gently undulating hills, lined with cypress trees and covered by a patchwork of fields, olive groves and vineyards, tiny rural villages, fascinating hilltop towns and great art cities. This is the landscape you cross\u00a0 while cycling to Siena (116 km). You can shorten the stage\u00a0 by cycling up to Montalcino: from here take a train directly to Siena (70 km).\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 5: Siena\u00a0 - Volterra (73 km)<\/strong><strong>\r\n<\/strong>Leaving Siena behind, you continue cycling along the Francigena Way, \u00a0crossing some little villages like Sovicille until reaching Abbadia a Isola. Little known fact: the church of this town is known for being similar to the entrance to the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.\u00a0 Along the way, you have the chance to see the Castle of Monteriggioni. You then continue for Castel Petraio\u00a0 and then Colle Val d' Elsa, the so-called \"Bohemia of Italy\". Colle Val d\u2019Elsa is an ancient Etruscan city; since 1100 it had been allied to Florence against Siena. From the 15<sup>th<\/sup> century onwards, the town started to flourish, mainly thanks to the development of the glass craftsmanship and trade and the related exploitation of the river Elsa. Possible visit to an handicraft laboratory of crystal manufactures. From Colle Val d\u2019Elsa you cycle to San Gimignano. From the hilltop where it was founded, this town dominates the Elsa Valley and stands as a splendid example of a well-preserved Medieval city. Its fame is mostly due to\u00a0 the numerous towers still adorning it. Thanks to its uniqueness, in 1990, it was awarded the title of World Heritage Site by Unesco. The village, rising behind its high walls, is split by two main axis forming a cross: the east-west axis stretches from the Hill of the Tower to the Hill of Montestaffoli, while the north-south axis goes from the Gate of San Giovanni to the Gate of San Matteo, another pass-through point of the Via Francigena. In the late afternoon, you arrive in Volterra. This city can boast about 3000 years of history and is known all over the world for its workshops specialized in the sculpting of alabaster.

Rocks seem to have been thrown from above, creating their weird shapes and arrangements. The formation has volcanic origins and the color of the stone is due to the specific mix of minerals in its composition. It was then eroded over millions of years by water and wind, which shaped the stunning landscape we can see today.

Seven kilometers away from the coast, the pink chaos gives shape to Rouzic, Costans, Malban, Bono, Ile aux Moines, Ile Plate, and Le Cerfs, for a total of 40 hectares of pure splendor overhanging the mighty Atlantic abysses. Humans left these barren lands years ago, with the only exception of the two guardians of the lighthouse, coming here every 2 weeks. Today the archipelagos is home to many species of maritime birds, among which the famous puffins. When weather conditions allow it, the excursion also stops at the Ile-aux-Moines, the \u2018isle of monks\u2019.\r\n\r\n<em>*Today\u2019s program will be modified according to the boarding point and the tide tables for that specific day.

From here, we can enjoy the wonderful sight of ocean and land hugging each other in multiple ways. While the microclimate is constantly mild all year long, the landscape deeply varies throughout the day according to the tide. At high tide, the island is divided into two parts, the Ile Nord and the Ile Sud, connected only by the small bridge of Vauban.

After its construction, the project fell through but what we have today is a wonderful hiking path across the mountains and reaching the sea.","note":"Self-guided hiking tour","desc":"The <strong>Vandelli road<\/strong> was built following the desire of the Duke of Modena Francesco III d\u2019Este who wanted to have a safe access to the sea in the territory of its dukedom. The mathematician Domenico Vandelli was asked to draw the layout of a road <strong>enabling carriages to cross the Apennines and the Apuane Alps<\/strong>. After 10 years of works, the road was completed in 1751. Unfortunately, the itinerary turned out to be too insidious due to the presence of bandits and unfit for use in case of bad weather. For example, in winter it was too often inaccessible because of the snow so the project (and the road) was soon abandoned after its launch. Nowadays, the Vandelli road is a wonderful hiking path. After having visited the historic city center of <strong>Modena<\/strong> and its wonderful Roman Cathedral, which is part of the <strong>Unesco World Heritage Sites<\/strong>, you will reach La Santona, the highest spot in the itinerary. Walking through the ancient forest of Fignola, plunged in a <strong>wild and silent panorama<\/strong>, you will reach a splendid glacial basin to climb again up to 1700 m, arriving in San Pellegrino in Alpe. Afterwards you will go down the Garfagnana woods, coming across <strong>little hamlets, medieval villages and Roman parish churches<\/strong>. Finally you will cross the Apuane Alps, with their <strong>white peaks and the precious marble quarries<\/strong>: the wonderful panorama over the <strong>Tyrrhenian sea<\/strong> will finally open up in front of you. The last stretch of hiking will take you directly to the seashore of Marina di Massa.","prog":"<strong>Day 1: Modena\r\n<\/strong>Individual arrival in Modena and accommodation in hotel. Free time to visit the city. The historical centre of Modena let you dive straight into Middle Age: the main square \u2018Piazza Grande\u2019, the Duomo and the Ghirlandina tower form a beautiful ensemble which led in 1997 to the recognition of this area as UNESCO World Heritage Site. Another important building is the Ducal Palace, now hosting one of the most famous Italian Military Academies. Modena is also well-known all over the world for the Ferrari industry, whose seat is located in Maranello (about 20 km from Modena). In Modena you can visit the Museum Casa Enzo Ferrari, the\u00a0 creator of the brand Ferrari. The town is also rich in typical restaurants where you can taste traditional delicacies and dishes: from local gourmet ingredients such as famous\u00a0 Balsamic Vinegar of Modena and Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, to homemade stuffed pasta \u2018tortellini\u2019 and delicious cold cuts to be served together with \u2018gnocco fritto\u2019 and \u2018tigelle\u2019.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 2 : Pavullo \u2013 La Santona\u00a0\u00a0 6h40, +770\/-300m,\u00a0 25 km\/15.5 mi\r\n<\/strong>Transfer by public bus from Modena to Pavullo with your own luggage. When arriving, you will meet our driver at the bus stop: he will take care of delivering your luggage to your hotel. You can now start the first walking stage and discover some important monuments and villages on the Vandelli road. The first stop is the Castle of Montecuccoli, \u00a0main hub of the ancient system of defence of the Frignano area. Its existence was first documented in 1027, when the building was occupied by a German family of feudal overlords known as \u201cda Montecuccoli\u201d from the name of the place where the tower stood. Once arrived in Monzone, do not miss its important castle, dating from approximately \u00a0the XII Century and later destroyed.

This is a rock formation whose history can be traced back to 80 million years ago, when this region was covered with water and was part of the sea. Magma flowing out of the seabed immediately solidified, thus explaining the distinctive \u2018pillow\u2019 shape which gives to Sasso Tignoso its unmistakable appearance. Then, passing by the Giovannoni chapel with its portico topped by a single arch, you will enter in the Frignano Regional Park. This park, established in 1988, is a protected area covering 16 thousand hectares. Arrival in San Annapelago and dinner in Hotel.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 4: San Annapelago \u2013 San Pellegrino in Alpe\u00a0 \u00a03h45, \u00a0+600\/-150m, \u00a010 km\/6.50mi\r\n<\/strong>Leaving San Annapelago you will then reach San Pellegrino in Alpe, a beautiful hamlet whose first mention dates back from 1110. The city states of Modena and Lucca fought for years over the possession of this hamlet, where the mummified bodies of San Pellegrino and San Bianco are preserved.

To avoid it, you will take an even older route which drops down towards the valley of Castiglione. Passing by some \u201cmetati\u201d, traditional ovens to dry chestnuts, you will reach Castiglione Garfagnana, which was an important defensive stronghold for the Duchy of Lucca in the Este territory. The town stands within its XIV century walls, which form an irregular geometrical shape and have strong towers on their corners and besides the gateways. Leaving Castiglione we continue towards the Mulino di Sotto mill \u00a0and towards the town of Pieve Fosciana, with its ancient Church and the Baroque fa\u00e7ade. Finally, you will reach Castelnuovo Garfagnana.

Its castle was probably built in the XIII century, with the square central tower serving both as lookout post and prison. Italian poet Ludovico Ariosto lived here as Governor of the Garfagnana from 1522 to 1525. The first part of today\u2019s stage will lead you to the,fortress of Mount Alfonso, built by the Duke Alfonso II of the Este family in the second half of the XVI century.

From ancient age to the Romantic period, all major artists felt at some point attracted by the charm of this region. Travellers visiting this area are no exception to this feeling of awe and fascination, being captured by the <strong>richness of the<\/strong><strong> artistic treasures<\/strong>, the <strong>mildness of the climate<\/strong> and the <strong>beauty of the nature and landscape<\/strong>. In contrast with this \u2018Dolce Vita\u2019, the eruptions of the Vesuvius, the volcanic phenomena of the Phlegrean Fields and the frequent earthquakes pushed the population towards a perceived proximity to the world of the dead and to Gods themselves. It is also thanks to the rage of the volcano if we can visit <strong>Pompeii <\/strong>today, as this unique example of ancient times was buried in ashes in 79 AD. Heading southward, we discover Amalfi, the first Maritime Republic of Italy, a city that played a great role in the trade with the Orient and then in the transport of Crusaders. Enchanted by the lovely climate and the beauty of nature, many artists and princes commissioned the construction of their sumptuous villas along this stretch of coast, especially in Ravello. Towards the end of our hiking, as an extension of the peninsula, we encounter <strong>Capri<\/strong>, always delighting us with its beauty.\r\n\r\nThis is a tour not to be missed: in a week time, you will discover not only Naples and Pompeii, but also the routes of the <strong>Amalfi Coast, from Ravello to Positano<\/strong>, and two of the most beautiful Mediterranean islands in the Bay of Naples, <strong>Procida and Capri<\/strong>.","prog":"<strong>Day 1 <\/strong>:\u00a0 <strong>Napoli\r\n<\/strong>Individual arrival in Napoli.

actors, intellectuals, adventurers and business men for decades, if not centuries. To all those who love hiking, this area is never short of exciting itineraries facing the sea and suggestive walks across stone stairs and olive groves.","note":"Self-guided hiking tour","desc":"<strong>Naples<\/strong>\u00a0and its surroundings is one of the most important cradles of Italian culture and history: Romans and Greeks were here long before the flourishing of the Baroque palaces and churches of\u00a0<strong>Spaccanapoli<\/strong>. From ancient age to the Romantic period, all major artists felt at some point attracted by the charm of this region. Travellers visiting this area are no exception to this feeling of awe and fascination, being captured by the\u00a0<strong>richness of the<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>artistic treasures<\/strong>, the\u00a0<strong>mildness of the climate<\/strong>\u00a0and the\u00a0<strong>beauty of the nature and landscape<\/strong>. In contrast with this \u2018Dolce Vita\u2019, the eruptions of the Vesuvius, the volcanic phenomena of the Phlegrean Fields and the frequent earthquakes pushed the population towards a perceived proximity to the world of the dead and to Gods themselves. It is also thanks to the rage of the volcano if we can visit\u00a0<strong>Pompeii<\/strong>\u00a0today, as this unique example of ancient times was buried in ashes in 79 AD. Heading southward, we discover Amalfi, the first Maritime Republic of Italy, a city that played a great role in the trade with the Orient and then in the transport of Crusaders. Enchanted by the lovely climate and the beauty of nature, many artists and princes commissioned the construction of their sumptuous villas along this stretch of coast, especially in Ravello. Towards the end of our hiking, as an extension of the peninsula, we encounter\u00a0<strong>Capri<\/strong>, always delighting us with its beauty.\r\n\r\nThis is a tour not to be missed: in a week time, you will discover not only Naples and Pompeii, but also the routes of the\u00a0<strong>Amalfi Coast, from Ravello to Positano<\/strong>, and two of the most beautiful Mediterranean islands in the Bay of Naples,\u00a0<strong>Procida and Capri<\/strong>.","prog":"<strong>Day 1<\/strong> :\u00a0 <strong>Napoli\r\n<\/strong>Individual arrival in Napoli. You leave the luggage at the hotel and have a stroll to discover Spaccanapoli, the very heart of Naples, characterised by narrow streets, the laundry hanging outside the windows, the rich Baroque churches and palaces, the San Carlo Theatre, the Galleria Umberto I, the Plebiscito Square. Overnight stay in Naples hotel 4*.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 2<\/strong> : <strong>Napoli \u00a0\u2013 Ercolano \u00a0\u2013 Napoli\r\n<\/strong>Transfer with the \u201cCircumvesuviana\u201d train to Ercolano. Here you begin your climbing of Mount Vesuvius, first by bus and then on foot, enjoying the wonderful view over the Gulf of Naples. In the afternoon, you visit the archaeological site of Ercolano, which was buried in ashes together with Pompeii in the eruption of the volcano in 79 AD. Return to Naples with the \u201cCircumvesuviana\u201d train.\u00a0Overnight stay in Naples hotel 4*.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 3<\/strong>: <strong>Naples \u00a0\u2013 Capri \u00a0\u2013 Napoli\r\n<\/strong>Boat to Capri. From the tiny port of Marina Grande, the hike leads you to the Hermitage of the Holy Mother of Cetrella through the so-called Passetiello path, a narrow passage between rock faces overlooking the town of Capri and the sea. From the top, you can enjoy a stunning panoramic view on the island and the Gulf of Naples, dominated by Mount Vesuvius. The descent is along the stone steps built by Phoenicians in ancient times. Possibility of bathing.\u00a0Overnight stay in Naples hotel 4*.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 4<\/strong>: <strong>Napoli \u00a0\u2013 Pompei \u00a0\u2013 Agerola\r\n<\/strong>Transfer with the \u201cCircumvesuviana\u201d train to Pompeii. Visit to the buried town and the Villa of the Mysteries, the biggest open-air archaeological site of the world. The area bears remarkable testimony of human life in ancient times, as the huge eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD fixed forever under ash and lava the inhabitants in their daily activities. In the afternoon, private transfer to Amalfi Peninsula to reach the plateau of Agerola and your hotel.

From Marina di Praiano, public bus to Amalfi, the most powerful Maritime Republic in the Mediterranean Sea at the end of X century (possible visit to the Cloister of Paradise and church, and to the Paper Museum; possible bath). Back to Agerola by public bus. Dinner at the hotel.\r\n\r\n<strong>Day 6<\/strong> : <strong>Agerola \u00a0\u2013 Valle dei Mulini \u00a0\u2013 Agerola\r\n<\/strong>After breakfast public bus to Amalfi. Today, following the path still in use by locals and their mules to transport wood, you discover the \u2018Valle dei Mulini\u2019. The valley takes its name from the mills (\u2018mulini\u2019) scattered in the area and used for the production of pasta. The trek continues to Ravello where the cathedral dedicated to Saint Pantaleone stands out. From the village overhanging the sea, at an altitude of 300 meters above sea level, the view goes across the Gulf of Salerno and over to the Cilento Mountains.

Up until the 19th century,\u00a0 this coastal trail was the only way to get from the small isolated villages to the many tiny terraced fields and vineyards. As you descend, on one side you see over the entire peninsula and Capri;\u00a0 on the other side, you enjoy the view of the Gulf of Salerno. All along, you can admire the ancient work made by old men on these impervious terrains to create a safe area where people could take shelter during the Barbarian invasions following \u00a0the fall of Roman Empire. Once passed Montepertuso, overhung by the rock-face of the mountain, you descend to Positano. The colourful houses of Positano have been built in the shape of an amphitheatre overlooking the sea, giving its unique and picturesque touch to the village.

But then the unusual beauty of this place sets in with its dunes and tens of kilometers of sandy beaches flourishing in flora and fauna. Kite-surfing and the famous surf on the sand are popular activities here. The city center is characterized by low buildings, mainly of the last century, and Flemish influences.
