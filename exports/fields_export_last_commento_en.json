I just returned from this trip and we were with a total group of 18 people. I personally had 9 with me  (7 of my teenage students) and every bit of the trip was fantastic. I was amazed at the planning this must have taken to map out the routes. We stopped in the quaintest towns for \"coffee breaks\"and lunches. How they planned the appropriate distances each day to stop in these towns for breaks and then get us to our end of day destination is amazing. Our guide, Ricardo, was fantastic. He has the perfect personality for this job. He made sure that this was a holiday for us. He was patient with the 7 students as they had little biking experience. They thoroughly enjoyed being around him and he made the trip enjoyable for them. \r\nThe hotels were great, the meals were fantastic (albeit a bit long) and everything was so well organized. When I stopped to think about all the moving pieces of putting this trip together, I am boggled at how they made it look so easy. I can't wait to return for another trip myself to do some research for future trips for my students.

The Amalfi Coast is stunning! Traveling by bike, we had a new \u2018wow\u2019 moment nearly every time we came around a corner. And then traveling by boat, we saw the coast in a whole new breathtaking way. The islands of Capri, Ischia, and Procida were equally beautiful and fascinating. One of my favorite experiences was watching sunrise from the deck of our boat, the sun illuminating the buildings and churches of the village, a spectacular view I would not have seen from a hotel.\r\nOur guide Alex was fantastic! Her enthusiasm and love for this place made every day special. Her knowledge of the terrain and of the locals enabled us to experience the best of the views, the food (gelato!), and the local culture. She was safety conscious and kept a pace that suited the cycling levels of the group.\r\nOur crew was also very attentive and made us feel right at home. The boat was clean, the food was good, and the service was excellent.
